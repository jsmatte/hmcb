repo for Hidden Markov Chain Building pacakge

See DCOC notebook for an example of how the pacakge can be used. The example uses the data from the <a href="http://crm.umontreal.ca/probindustrielsEn2021/index.php/coveo-eng/">11th Montreal Industrial Problem Solving Workshop (IPSW) Coveo Problem</a>.

Note that the code for higher order MC is still in development.
